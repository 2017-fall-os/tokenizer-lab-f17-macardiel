# os-tokenizer-lab

My implementation of the tokenizer follows concepts and pseudocode explained in the text
"The C Programming Language" second edition by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie,
as well as "OperatingSystems: Three Easy Pieces" by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and
Andrea C Arpaci-Dusseau. Code excerpts and ideas also influenced by demo code 
provided by Dr. Eric Freudenthal. Discussion of pseudo code and ideas for better 
inplementation discussed with fellow classmate Oliver Martinez, Computer Science.
